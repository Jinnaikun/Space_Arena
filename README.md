-CONTROLS-
Enter the Arena, collect all of the point orbs to win, and watch out for the red enemies!

D - Turn right

Power Up Cubes:
Purple: Give your ship a magnet ability to pull in orbs temporarily
Green: Double your ship's current speed temporarily

B.Innovation:
*Minimap

*You cannot back out of the arena after you enter (Level triggers closes after player enters and turns into a collider. Can't go out
even if you enter the arena line partially and back out).

*Trigger Volume that teleports player to the "play zone" side of the arena line. The volume only works once (intented).

*Magnet Power up

*Player upgrade timers stack with each other. Getting the speed boost then magnet will cause the speed boost timer to reset.
This is more visually obvious when the trails start to change color.
